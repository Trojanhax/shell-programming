# Case Statements in Shell Programming

Case statements, also known as switch statements in some programming languages, are essential for making decisions based on multiple possible values or conditions in shell scripting. They provide an efficient way to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of a variable or an expression. In this article, we'll explore case statements in shell programming, how to use them effectively, and provide practical examples.

## Introduction to Case Statements

A case statement is structured as follows:

```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # Code to execute when expression matches pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # Code to execute when expression matches pattern2
        ;;
    ...
    *)
        # Code to execute when no patterns match
        ;;
esac
```
- expression is the variable or expression you want to evaluate.  

- pattern1, pattern2, and so on are the possible values or conditions you want to check.

- *) represents a default case that is executed when none of the specified patterns match.

Each pattern is followed by a set of commands, and the double semicolon ;; signifies the end of each pattern block.

## Using Case Statements
Case statements are typically used when you want to evaluate a variable or expression against multiple possible values and execute specific code based on the match. Here's an example of a case statement in a shell script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

fruit="apple"

case "$fruit" in
    "apple")
        echo "It's an apple."
        ;;
    "banana")
        echo "It's a banana."
        ;;
    "cherry")
        echo "It's a cherry."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "It's an unknown fruit."
        ;;
esac

```
In this example, the value of the fruit variable is evaluated against various patterns, and the corresponding block of code is executed based on the match. If none of the patterns match, the default case is executed.

## Case Statements with Patterns
Case statements can use patterns that include wildcards (*) for partial matches or regular expressions for more complex conditions. Here's an example using wildcards:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

day="Wednesday"

case "$day" in
    "Mon"*)
        echo "It's a Monday."
        ;;
    "Tue"*)
        echo "It's a Tuesday."
        ;;
    "Wed"*)
        echo "It's a Wednesday."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "It's an unknown day."
        ;;
esac

```

n this example, the wildcard * allows partial matches for days of the week, so "Wednesday" matches the pattern "Wed"*.

## Case Statements with Regular Expressions
You can also use regular expressions in case statements for more complex matching. However, this requires using the [[ ... ]] syntax and the =~ operator:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

text="Hello, World!"

case "$text" in
    "Hello"*)
        echo "Text starts with 'Hello'."
        ;;
    "World!"*)
        echo "Text ends with 'World!'."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "No pattern matched."
        ;;
esac

```
